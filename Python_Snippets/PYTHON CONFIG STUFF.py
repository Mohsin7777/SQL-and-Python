JUPYTER LAB: - Root
From Admin Command prompt (regular or anaconda):
1 > cd /D X:\Python_Scripts\Jupyter_Stuff
launch command:
2 > jupyter lab

JUPYTER LAB - Tensorflow
1) Launch Admin level Commandprompt for the Tensorflow environment
(Either the tensorflow prompt shortcut, or via Navigator)
2) Launch the Command Prompt
3) cd /D X:\Python_Scripts\Jupyter_Stuff
4) jupyter lab

NOTE: Tensorflow environment is needed because it has its own dependencies
>>>>>>> Need to install all needed libraries (pandas etc.) within this environment manually, through the navigator GUI

# Note: Any dataset downloaded in Keras/Tensorflow will save to: C:\Users\Administrator\.keras\datasets (or tensorflow_datasets)

PYTHON install location:
(within Anaconda3's root folder (currently python 3.7))
X:\Anaconda\

** Only use Conda to install packages now wherever possible!!
(pip only for stuff conda doesnt have, and install in seperate environment) **

First update conda to latest:
> conda update -n root conda

Then update all packages
> conda update --all
(NOTE: it will sometimes need to downgrade certain packages to match dependences)
